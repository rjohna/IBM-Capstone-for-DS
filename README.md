# SpaceX

This repository includes products used to satisfy requirements for the Capstone Project as part of the coursera IBM Data Science Professional Specialization.

In this project, we want to determine if we can predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.  SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of $62M; other providers cost up to $165M; much of the savings because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

If we can determine whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

We obtained launch data from SpaceX and open-source web sites, applied Exploratory Data Analysis and Interactive Visual Analytic methods to develop and refine Feature Sets and Launch Outcome Label Sets, and then predicted launch outcomes using Predictive Analysis algorithms.

Files S1 thru S8 address course assignments with Jupyter notebooks.  The SpaceX Final Presentation provides results.
